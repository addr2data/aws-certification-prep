Introduction
------------
Recently, I decided to pursue AWS certification. Mostly for career reasons, but also because being able to spin up infrastructure with a few API calls fascinates me. I've been playing with AWS EC2, off and on, since 2012, but have never used it in any meaningful way. Considering how much the AWS ecosystem has grown over the years, it seems I have my work cut out for me.

In addition to certification, my goal is to become a skilled user of AWS services. I am willing to spend a few bucks each month, so I should be able to get a decent amount of hands-on experience. I plan to leverage the AWS CLI extensively, but I also want to get comfortable writing scripts that leverage the API directly, so I plan to work with Python and Boto3.  

I have created this public GitHub project to force myself to be more organized with my notes and code. I am going to approach this project, as if I am building a training resource for others. I know this approach will help me on my journey, but I sincerely hope others find value in it.

**I expect this project to be a work-in-progress for at least 12 months.**

Certifications
--------------
At this point, my intention is to pursue the following certifications. I choose the **Solution Architect** certifications, because I felt, they would provide the most bang for my buck, from a career perspective. I added the **Advanced Networking** certification, because I have a strong interesting in networking. It is possible these choices with change over time, but for now that is the plan.  

-  AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate
-  AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty
-  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional

Exam Guides

Here are the links for each of the exam guides/blueprints.

AWS Services
------------
At this point, I feel like the following AWS services are in-scope for this project. I am sure this will change over time, but you have to start somewhere. I will start by building exercises and code-samples for EC2 and VPC, since I am most familiar with those services.

Tools
-----
Initially, I will be working with the following 'tools'. I will update this list as I start to work with others.

- AWS Console (I hope to use this sparingly)
- AWS CLI
- Python3
- Boto3

Approach
--------
As I develop my knowledge and prepare for the exams listed above, I will be using the following process (for multiple services in parallel).

1. Learn the basics of a service.
2. Get comfortable with the basic configuration and use of that service.
3. Build some basic exercises that others could follow and in the process solidify my own understanding.
4. Dig deeper into that service. Get comfortable with advanced configuration, use and design considerations.
5. Build some advanced exercises that others could follow and in the process solidify my own understanding.
6. Understand how that service fits into an overall architecture.
7. Be able to discuss that service with others, in a sales/services context.
8. Rinse and repeat.

Regarding the exercises in this project
---------------------------------------
Following the exercises in this project will generate costs to your AWS account. These should be relatively small, especially if you are new to AWS (increased eligibility for free-tier). An explanation of the expected costs will be provided at the beginning of each exercise.

Account Setup
-------------
If you follow along with this project. You will need to set up some accounts. Here are the links.

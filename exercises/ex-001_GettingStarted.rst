   * - Depends on exercise(s)
     - None
   * - Prerequisite for exercise(s)
     - All

Objectives
----------

- Get your local environment ready.
- Create an AWS IAM user that will allow programmatic access to the EC2 API.
- Use **awscli** to briefly explore EC2.
- Familiarize yourself with a couple **awscli** commandline options.

Expected Costs
--------------
The activities in this exercise are NOT expected to result in charges to your AWS account.

Initial
-------
Install **git** and **virtualenv**, if you don't already have them installed.

- git is used to acquire the latest version of this repository
- virtualenv is used to to manage Python packages for different projects. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could break system tools or other projects. 
- jq is used to parse json data

On Ubuntu, you would simply run

.. code-block::
    
    sudo apt-get install git virtualenv jq

Here are the links:

- `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_
- `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
- `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>`_

Clone this GitHub repo
----------------------
.. code-block::

	git clone git@github.com:addr2data/aws-certification-prep.git

If you don't have your SSH key(s) added GitHub, you can use HTTP instead.

.. code-block::
	
	git clone https://github.com/addr2data/aws-certification-prep.git

Set up your virtual environment
--------------------------------

.. code-block::

 virtualenv aws-certification-prep
 cd aws-certification-prep
 source bin/activate


Install requirements
--------------------

.. code-block::

 	pip install boto3 docopt awscli

Set up a user account for API access
------------------------------------
- Login to your AWS account.
- Under services select **IAM**.
- Select **users**
- Click **Add user**
- Under **Set user details**, enter user name **apiuser01**.
- Under **Select AWS access type**, select **Programmatic access**.
- Click on **Next: Permissions**.
- Under **Set permissions for apiuser01**, select **Attach existing policies directly**.
- Search for **AmazonEC2FullAccess**, then select **AmazonEC2FullAccess** (we will add access to other services later).
- Click on **Next: Review**.
- Click **Create user**.
- On the following screen, copy the values for **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.

Create a credentials file
-------------------------

.. code-block::

	mkdir ~/.aws
	vi ~/.aws/credentials

Insert the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** that you copied in the previous step. Save the file.

.. code-block::

	[default]
	aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
	aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

Create a configuration file
---------------------------

.. code-block::

	vi ~/.aws/config

Insert the appropriate region for your location (see **AWS Regions** table below).

.. code-block::

    [default]
    region = YOUR_REGION
    output = json

Verify access
-------------
Use the following awscli command to verify that you are able to access the EC2 API by attempting to show the EC2 regions.

.. code-block::

	aws ec2 describe-regions

    {
        "Regions": [
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ap-south-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "eu-west-3"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "eu-west-2"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "eu-west-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ap-northeast-2"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ap-northeast-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "sa-east-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ca-central-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ap-southeast-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "ap-southeast-2"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "eu-central-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "us-east-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.us-east-2.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "us-east-2"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "us-west-1"
            },
            {
                "Endpoint": "ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
                "RegionName": "us-west-2"
            }
        ]
    }

Using the **'--dry-run'** option lets you verify access without actually runninng the command. Don't be fooled by the **'An error occurred'** part of the message, the operation was successful.

.. code-block::

    aws ec2 describe-regions --dry-run

    An error occurred (DryRunOperation) when calling the DescribeRegions operation: Request would have succeeded, but DryRun flag is set.

Verify restriction
------------------
Use the following awscli command to verify that you NOT are able to access the IAM API

.. code-block::

    aws iam get-account-summary

    An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetAccountSummary operation: User: arn:aws:iam::926075045128:user/apiuser01 is not authorized to perform: iam:GetAccountSummary on resource: *

Formatting output
-----------------
Use the following awscli command with **'--output text'** and **'--output table'** options to see different output formats.

.. code-block::

    aws ec2 describe-regions --output text

    REGIONS ec2.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com    ap-south-1
    REGIONS ec2.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com eu-west-3

Summary
-------
- You have set up your local environment.
- You have created a IAM user **apiuser01** and gave it programmatic access only.
- You have assigned **apiuser01** full access to the EC2 API.
- You used **awscli** to verify that **apiuser01** has access to the EC2 API.
- You used **awscli** to verify that **apiuser01** does NOT have access to the IAM API.
- You used **awscli** to explore AWS **regions** and **Availability Zones**.
- You experimented with a couple of **awscli** commandline options.
